Title: A Package for Finite Element Analysis of Microscale Structures

Description: This package is developed as a companion package to the book
    "R for Finite Element Analyses of Size-dependent Microscale Structures".
    It is a collection of functions to assist in the computations of bending,
    free vibration and bucking analysis of Timoshenko microscale beams as well as
    Kirchhoff microscale plates. 
    The finite element models implemented in this package are based on the 
    modified couple stress theory.
