# microfiniteR
This package is developed as a companion material to the book
    ["R for Finite Element Analyses of Size-dependent Microscale Structures"](https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9789811370137).
    It is a collection of functions to assist in the computations of bending,
    free vibration and bucking analyses of microscale beams and plates.
    The finite element models are based on the Timoshenko beam and Kirchhoff plate formulations within the framework of the modified couple stress theory.

# Installation
The package installation requires base R, [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/) and the devtools package.

#install.packages("devtools")

devtools::install_github("khameelbm/microfiniteR")


# Documentation
Documentation of the package was done via the [roxygen package](https://github.com/klutometis/roxygen). 
Once the package is installed, the description of the functions can be accessed via the usual function querry in R.
