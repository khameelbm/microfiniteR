# microfiniteR
This package is developed as a companion package to the book
    "R for Finite Element Analyses of Size-dependent Microscale Structures".
    It is a collection of functions to assist in the computations of bending,
    free vibration and bucking analyses of microscale beams and plates.
    The finite element models are based are the Timoshenko beam and Kirchhoff plate theories within the framework of the modified couple stress theory.
